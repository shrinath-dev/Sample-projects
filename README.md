# Sample-projects

This repository contains my demo projects and projects that created to practice some concepts, built as part of my learning journey. I’ll keep adding more projects as I explore new skills. You can recreate them on your own for practicing purpose.

Here is another major project I developed as part of my React learning journey: Phlipkart, a small but functional API-driven e-commerce application.
While building this project, I learned and applied key React ecosystem concepts such as Redux Toolkit, Context API, React Router, and React Redux. I also focused on clean folder organization, scalable project structure, and creating an accessible and user-friendly UI.
